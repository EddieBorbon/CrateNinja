# CrateNinja 🎮💥

## Game Description
**CrateNinja** is an interactive game where players must click on objects that randomly appear on the screen. The game features a set of objects that fall from the bottom of the screen, with three being "good" and one being "bad." The goal is to click on the good objects to destroy them, while avoiding the bad one. The objects are launched with random forces and torques, creating unpredictable movement in the air.
